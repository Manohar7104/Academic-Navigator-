AI-powered Campus Management Platform
🎓 Academic Navigator – Guiding the Future of Campus Management
Academic Navigator is a smart campus management platform built to connect students, faculty, parents, and admins in one place.
It helps in checking attendance, marks, fees, and communication in real time, with the support of AI chatbot and instant alerts.
📌 Problem We Saw
Most colleges and schools still depend on registers, offline records, and late updates.
Because of this:
Faculty lose time doing repetitive admin work
Students don’t get all updates in one place
Parents are informed very late about attendance or fee dues
Admins struggle with transparency across departments
💡 Our Idea
We created Academic Navigator to make things simple and transparent:
📊 Student Dashboard – Attendance, marks, fees in one view
🤖 AI Chatbot (Gemini API) – Answers academic questions & suggests library books
🔔 Alerts – SMS/Email for parents using Twilio & SendGrid
📚 Resource Hub – Notes, assignments, study material
💳 Smart Fee Tracker – Online fee payment with reminders
🔒 Feedback System – Safe space for student complaints
🧑‍💼 Faculty & HoD Tools – Easy account creation and management
🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Django REST Framework
Database: MySQL
AI: Gemini API for chatbot and NLP
Notifications: Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (Email)
Version Control: GitHub (with future cloud deployment plans)
🚀 What’s Next
📱 Mobile app (Flutter) for both students & parents
📊 AI predictions for student performance
☁️ Cloud hosting to handle scale
🏫 Expanding the system to schools and intermediate colleges with features suited to their needs
